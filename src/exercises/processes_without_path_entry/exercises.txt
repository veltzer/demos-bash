find all currently running processes which do not have a certain folder in their path.

For instance:
$ sudo ./solution /usr/bin
will show all currently running processess which do not have "/usr/bin" in their PATH evironment variable.

Hints:
* all processes are reprented as files with numerical names in /proc. For instance process 100 is the folder /proc/100.
* all processes related foldres have a file called 'environ' in them, with all of their environment variables.
	these are of the form "NAME=value" and are seperated by the null character (0).
	You must find a way to separate these out.
* you can get all processes on the current system in two ways:
	* run "ps -ef" and take the column id
	* get all folders in /proc which have a numerical name (and use =~ to make sure they are numerical).
