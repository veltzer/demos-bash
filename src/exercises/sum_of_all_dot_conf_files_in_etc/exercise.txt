Write a script that prints the sum of size of all files
in /etc/ that you can access (recursively) and that have the suffix
".conf"

You are required (for good reasons) to write a script with two phases:
- first phase will create a text file with all the sizes that you want to add up
- second phase will add up all the sizes
