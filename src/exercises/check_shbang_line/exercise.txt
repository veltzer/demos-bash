Given a folder name, go over all files in the folder. If the file is executable
then check that it has a correct "#!/bin/bash" first line. If not then create a new
file with the name "$old_file.new" with a correct shbang line and the old files content.

Create your input folder with scripts in it for testing purposes and this way make sure your script is correct.
