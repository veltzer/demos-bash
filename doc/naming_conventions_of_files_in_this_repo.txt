bash files: *.bash
included bash files: *.bashinc

Why the separation between them?

- So that we could change the first line of all bash
script easily.
- So that we could check the modes of all files easily.
- So that we could run linting more easily.
- So that we could differentiate between bash related files
	and all other files that may be in this repo (python etc)
