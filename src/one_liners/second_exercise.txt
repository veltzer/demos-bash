	What I mean is DIRECTLY UNDER /etc/
	(if the file is /etc/foo/bar I don't care about it)
	The result should be ONLY the file name.

	use the following commands:
	ls -l
	sort
	tail/head
	tr -s
	cut

solutions:
	ls -l /etc/ | sort -k 5 -n | tail -1 | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 9
	ls -lS /etc/ | head -2 | tail -1 | tr -s  " " | cut -d " " -f 9
	ls -lSr /etc/ | tail -1 | tr -s  " " | cut -d " " -f 9
