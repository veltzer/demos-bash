Write a script which implements the game "guess the number".

The script picks a random number between 1 and 100 and the user has to guess it.
If the users number is too high/low then the script tells the user so and asks for another number.
If the user guesses the right number the script prints a success message and exists.
The user has 5 guesses to guess the right number. If he doesn't succeed in 5 guesses the script
prints out a "you lose!" message and exist...

Append the number of attempts the user made to solve the riddle to a file called "attempts.txt" so that the user
can track his progress. Do this when the users wins or loses.
