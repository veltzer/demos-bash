Write a script that shows a file in a tabular format.
Here is an example of a file:
=========>8=============
Mark Python 8
Doron Java 5
=========>8=============
The output should be like this:
Mark    Python  8
Doron   Java    5
Note that the output is totally tabular and each column is 8 characters wide.
What do you need to do?
Read the values in the original table and "pad" them with spaces so that each entry
will be 8 characters wide.
Dont worry about entries which are more than 7 characters wide, there will be no entires like that.
